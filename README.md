ðŸŽµ AI Mood-Based Playlist Generator
An intuitive web application that generates personalized Spotify playlists based on natural language mood descriptions. Powered by Gemini AI for mood interpretation and Spotify API for playlist creation, this project makes music discovery effortless and fun.

ðŸ“– Project Description:-
Finding the right playlist for your mood often takes time and effort. This application solves that problem by allowing users to type in a mood, vibe, or activity (e.g., "chill evening by the beach", "focus and study", "dance party with friends").
Gemini AI interprets the natural language input.
Spotify API curates a playlist that matches the vibe.
The app then displays the playlist with track details, album art, and playback options.
