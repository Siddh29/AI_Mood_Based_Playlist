Overview
---
Finding the right playlist for your mood often takes time and effort. 

This application solves that problem by allowing users to type in a mood, vibe, or activity (e.g., "chill evening by the beach", "focus and study", "dance party with friends").

Gemini AI interprets the natural language input.

Spotify API curates a playlist that matches the vibe.

The app then displays the playlist with track details, album art, and playback options.
